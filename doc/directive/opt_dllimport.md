Asmc Macro Assembler Reference

### OPTION DLLIMPORT

This option makes the assembler assume that all PROTOs that follow this directive represent functions located in a dll. Syntax:

**OPTION DLLIMPORT**:<dll_name> | NONE

<dll_name> must be enclosed in angle brackets. Argument NONE will switch back to the default mode.
