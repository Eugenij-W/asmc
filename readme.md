# Asmc Macro Assembler

   Asmc is a modified version of JWasm and the source is released
   under the Sybase Open Watcom Public License. For more information
   about JWasm: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwasm/

   Asmc adds some features to the HLL section and a few other things.

## Requirements

   ASMC.EXE should run on any 32- or 64-bit Windows.

   Memory requirements depend on the source which is assembled. The source
   itself is not kept in memory, but the symbol table is, and this table
   can easily grow to several MBs if huge amounts of equates are defined.
