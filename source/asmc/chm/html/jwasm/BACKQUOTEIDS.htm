<H1>   3.3 IDs enclosed in Back Quotes</H1>

    IDs can be enclosed in back quotes (`) and thus they can contain
    characters not allowed in "normal" IDs. However, there is at least one case
    where IDs in back quotes won't be recognized: if the expansion operator (%)
    is located at position 0 in a line.
<P>
    Example using back quotes:
<P>
    Module 1:
<pre><font color="#008040">    `functionname.with.dots` PROC C PUBLIC a1:dword</font></pre>
<P>
    Module 2:
<pre><font color="#008040">    `functionname.with.dots` PROTO C :dword
    .code
    INVOKE `functionname.with.dots`, 1</font></pre>
<P> 
    Since IDs in back quotes are not 100% compatible with "normal" IDs, it might
    be considered to use the <b>ALIAS</b> directive instead. Be aware that,
    since the alias handling is a linker task, it is necessary to define both names,
    the alias name and the target name, as public.
