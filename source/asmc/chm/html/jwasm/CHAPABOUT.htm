    This document lists the differences between JWasm and Masm, as far as
    the user interface is concerned.
<P> 
    When Masm is mentioned, then usually Masm v8.00 is meant, unless stated
    otherwise. Masm v8.00 also was the first Masm version supporting 64-bit
    (ML64.EXE).
<P> 
    The Masm documentation itself can be found on numerous places in the web,
    in plain text, HTML, PDF and Windows Help format. However, it's usually
    just the documentation that came whith Masm v6.1 - hence a bit outdated
    nowadays ( the changes from Masm v6 to Masm v8 are listed in
    <A HREF="AD.htm">Appendix D</A> ).
