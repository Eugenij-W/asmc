<H1>   2. Commandline Options</H1>
 
    Entering 'JWasm -?' or 'JWasm -h' will make JWasm display the options
    it understands. A lot of them exist in both Masm and JWasm, but some
    are valid for JWasm only; OTOH, a few options are missing in JWasm.
<P> 
    Options are usually entered via the command line. Additionally, when
    starting, JWasm will search for <b>environment variable JWASM</b>
    and handle it similar to the way Masm handles variable ML. Hence it is
    also possible to enter options via this method.
<P> 
    The options specific to JWasm - and also the options which are handled
    somewhat differently by JWasm compared to Masm - will be handled in the
    following chapters.
<P> 
    One major difference should be mentioned here: JWasm does never launch a
    linker on its own ( which Masm does unless option -c is given ). This
    makes a few Masm options useless for JWasm, and hence they are not implemented;
    see Chapter <A HREF="CHAPKNOWNBUGS.htm">Known Bugs and missing Features</A> for
    details.
