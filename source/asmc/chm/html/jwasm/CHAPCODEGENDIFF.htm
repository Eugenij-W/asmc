<H1>   5. Code Generation Differences</H1>

    JWasm might generate slightly different code than Masm on some occasions.
    Commandline option <A HREF="CMDOPTZG.htm">-Zg</A> should eliminate most of these differences.
    However, some differences are due to fixed Masm bugs (see below), in
    which case option -Zg won't have any effect.
<P>
    For a few instructions, the encoding differs between Masm versions.
<P> Example:
<PRE><font color="#008040">    cmp al,dl
</font></PRE><P>
    is encoded <TT>38 D0</TT> in Masm v6, but <TT>3A C2</TT> in Masm v8.
    In such cases, JWasm will prefer to copy the encoding of Masm v8.
