<H1>   9. Known Bugs and missing Features</H1>

<H2>    a) Bugs which are known but not fixed yet: </H2>

    There are currently no known bugs.

<H2>    b) Features which aren't implemented yet: </H2>
<DL> 
<DD>    - directives PAGE, TITLE, SUBTITLE, SUBTTL.
      the directives are ignored and a warning (level 4) is displayed.
<DD>    - the following parameters of the OPTION directive:
<DL>
<DD>      - OLDMACROS
<DD>      - EXPR16
<DD>      - READONLY
</DL>
<DD>    - optional parameter NONUNIQUE for structures is ignored.
<DD>    - commandline option -AT (Enable tiny model).
<DD>    - commandline options -Sp, -Ss and -St (set page length, subtitle and title).
<DD>    - commandline option -H (set max external name length).
<DD>    - commandline option -Ta (Assemble non-.ASM file).
<DD>    - commandline option -Zd for ELF output format.
<DD>    - commandline option -Zi for ELF output format.
</DL> 
<P>
    If there's ever a problem with one of the missing features, it's very likely
    that it's related to OPTION OLDMACROS. This option makes Masm 6 emulate two
    Masm 5.1 peculiarities:
<DL>
<DD>    - macro arguments may be separated by spaces
<DD>    - ampersands (&amp;) inside the macro must match the current level of
          macro nesting.
</DL>
<H2>    c) Missing features which most likely won't be implemented: </H2>
<DL> 
<DD>    - syntax "mm(n)" and "xmm(n)" (supported by Masm v6 and v7 only)
<DD>    - commandline option -Bl, -F, -Fe, -Fm and -link: since JWasm doesn't launch a linker, those
          options are useless.
<DD>    - commandline options -Fr and -FR (generate browser info).
<DD>    - commandline option -Sc (generate timings in listing).
<DD>    - commandline option -errorReport (Report internal assembler errors to Microsoft).
</DL>
