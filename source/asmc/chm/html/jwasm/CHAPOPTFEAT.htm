<H1>   8. Optional Features</H1>

  There exist some features that are not activated in the
  precompiled binaries. To enable these options, the JWasm source must be
  recompiled with one or more switches set in the command line:

<H2>    Support for Djgpp's variant of COFF</H2>
  This option is enabled with switch <b>-DDJGPP_SUPPORT</b>. The generated JWasm
  binary will accept an additional output format (-djgpp) to be set in the
  commandline, that makes the assembler generate COFF modules compatible with DJGPP.
  
<H2>    Support for Assembly Source generated by Intel C++ compiler</H2>
  This option is enabled with switch <b>-DDOTNAMEX</b>. It will make the
  assembler accept names that contain dots if the name starts with a dot
  or an underscore. Note that this behavior is not compatible with standard
  Masm syntax.
