<H1>   Option -zc: Set Name Decoration for C</H1>

    This option sets the name decoration for the C ( aka CDECL ) calling convention. There are
    two variants:
<DL> 
<DD>  -zc[m|w]
</DL> 
    -zcm is the default, C names are decorated with an underscore prefix. This is also the way
    Masm does it. The other variant, -zcw, omits the prefix altogether. This is the usual "decoration"
    in Unix/Linux.
