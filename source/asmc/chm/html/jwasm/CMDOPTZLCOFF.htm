<H1>   Options -zlf, -zlp and -zls: Control Content of COFF Output Module</H1>

    Options -zlf, -zlp and -zls do reduce size of the COFF output module.
    They might be useful if lots of - small - modules are to be assembled
    and put into a static library.

<TR BGCOLOR="#E8E8E8"><TD>-zlf</TD>
<TD>suppresses the @file entry in the COFF symbol table. This entry is
    usually used for debugging purposes only and hence a - pretty small - amount of space can be saved.
</TD></TR>
<TR BGCOLOR="#E8E8E8"><TD>-zlp</TD>
<TD>suppresses static (=private) procedures to be included into the COFF
    symbol table - as long as they aren't referenced absolutely. Such procedures
    aren't needed for the linking process. However, since the linker has no knowledge
    of them then, they will also disappear from the linker-generated map-file.<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR BGCOLOR="#E8E8E8"><TD>-zls</TD>
<TD>suppresses the auxiliary entries for sections in the COFF symbol table.
    These entries may not be needed in all cases and thus a little space
    is saved.
