<H1>   Options -zlc and -zld: Control Content of OMF Output Module</H1>

    Options -zlc and -zld do reduce size of the OMF output module.
    They might be useful if lots of - small - modules are to be assembled
    and put into a static library. Also, the OMF coment records written
    if -zlc or -zld is NOT set may not be accepted by all linkers.
<P> 
<DL>
<DT>    Option -zlc:</DT>
<DD>    suppresses writing OMF coment records about data in Code segments. 
    These records may help a disassembler to produce nicer listings.
<DT>    Option -zld:</DT>
<DD>    suppresses writing an OMF coment record for each Code segment telling the 
    linker that far calls to targets in the same segments should be optimized. 
    This is more or less a feature for 16-bit code only.
