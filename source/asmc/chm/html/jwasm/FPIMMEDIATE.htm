<H1>   3.4 Floating-Point Immediates in Instructions</H1>

    Floating-point immediate values are accepted as instruction operands.
    As default, the type is a REAL4, which has a magnitude of 32 bits:
<pre><font color="#008040"> 
        mov eax, 1.0
</font></pre><P>
    With type coercion, it's also possible to define a
    64-bit "double", although it's probably useful in 64-bit code only: 
<pre><font color="#008040"> 
        mov rax, real8 ptr 1.0
</font></pre><P> 
    Additionally, operators LOW32 and HIGH32 accept a floating-point constant
    as argument. In this case, the constant is assumed to have format
    REAL8. Thus it's possible to pass a double constant directly as a
    procedure argument in 32-bit code:
<pre><font color="#008040"> 
       push HIGH32 1.0
       push LOW32 1.0
       call WorkWithReal8Value
</font></pre><P>
