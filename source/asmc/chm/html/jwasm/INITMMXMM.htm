<H1>   3.19 Initialization of Data Items with Type MMWORD/XMMWORD</H1>

    For data items of types MMWORD or XMMWORD, JWasm will accept integer
    values for initialization:
<P><pre><font color="#008040"> 
    vmm1  MMWORD  1122334455667788h
    vxmm1 XMMWORD 112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFFh
</font></pre><P> 
    Masm will accept just floating-point initializers for data items of
    type [X]MMWORD. It's even worse, since floating-point initializers are
    <b>silently</b> ignored for data items with  sizes != 4, 8 and 10; since
    XMMWORD has size 16, it's impossible to initialize such an item directly.
    JWasm copies this Masm behavior, but to allow to initialize a XMMWORD 
    with a floating-point value, one may use type coercion:
<P><pre><font color="#008040"> 
    vxmm1 XMMWORD real4 ptr 1.0   ;bytes 4-15 will be 0
    vxmm2 XMMWORD real8 ptr 1.0   ;bytes 8-15 will be 0
</font></pre><P>
    Variants that work in both JWasm and Masm, and also allow to
    initialize the full XMMWORD are:
<P><pre><font color="#008040"> 
    vxmm1 LABEL XMMWORD
      real4 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0
    vxmm2 LABEL XMMWORD
      real8 1.0, 2.0
</font></pre><P>
