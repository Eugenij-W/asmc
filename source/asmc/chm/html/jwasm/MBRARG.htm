<H1>   3.18 Member Argument for IF[N]DEF and .ERR[N]DEF Directives</H1>

    Since v2.07, JWasm's implementation of IF[N]DEF - and .ERR[N]DEF - will
    additionally accept a struct member as argument. This syntax requires
    a fully qualified name:
<P><pre><font color="#008040"> 
      IFDEF &lt;struct_name&gt;.&lt;member_name&gt;
</font></pre><P>
