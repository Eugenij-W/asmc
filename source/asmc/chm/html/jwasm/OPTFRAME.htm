<H1>   3.10 Directive OPTION FRAME</H1>

    This option affects 64-bit only. It allows to make JWasm automatically
    generate prologues and epilogues for procedures with the FRAME attribute.
    Thus the code complies to the rules of <A HREF="WIN64SEH.htm">Win64 SEH</A> (Structured Exception
    Handling). Syntax is
<DL style="color:#008040"> 
<DD>        OPTION FRAME:&lt;AUTO | NOAUTO&gt;
</DL> 
    AUTO will enable this feature, NOAUTO (which is default) disables it.
<P>
    The unwind information which is generated is "complete", that is, it
    contains the ".endprologue" pseudo-op already. To allow to save all
    non-volatile registers in the prologue, the "USES" phrase is more
    capable in this mode and will accept XMM registers to be saved and
    restored.
