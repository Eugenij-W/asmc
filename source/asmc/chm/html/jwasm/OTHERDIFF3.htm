<H1>   3.24.3 Accepted Parameters for IF[N]DEF Directive</H1>

    Masm's IF[N]DEF directive accepts user-defined symbols and registers,
    but fails for instructions, directives and other reserved words. JWasm's
    IF[N}DEF implementation accepts those symbols as well. OTOH, JWasm is
    a bit more picky and will display a warning if more than one item is 
    found behind the directive - Masm just takes the first and silently skips
    the rest.
