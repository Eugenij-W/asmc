<H1>   6.2 COFF Output Format</H1>

    The COFF object module format is suitable for flat, non-segmented memory models. In most cases
	the COFF format is used for 32-bit code. However, it's possible to create a 64-bit COFF module
	if the current cpu is <A HREF="DIRX64.htm">.x64</A> when the .MODEL directive is parsed 
	( note that <A HREF="CMDOPTWIN64.htm">-win64</A>
	is the usual way to create modules for 64-bit Windows ). To some extent 16-bit code
	is also supported with COFF, although <A HREF="OUTPUTFORMATOMF.htm">OMF</A> will always be the
	better choice then.

<UL>
<LI>The <b>-safeseh</b> cmdline option and the <b>.SAFESEH</b> directive are supported by COFF only.</LI>
<LI>Not supported by COFF are: 
<UL>
  <LI>the <b>GROUP</b> directive</LI>
  <LI>the directives to control segment order: <b>.ALPHA</b>, <b>.DOSSEG</b>, <b>.SEQ</b></LI>
  <LI>code that will generate "far" fixups (i.e. direct FAR calls or jumps ).</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>A few, common segment names are translated in the output module when COFF is selected:
<UL>
    <LI>name _TEXT is translated to .text</LI>
    <LI>name _DATA is translated to .data</LI>
    <LI>name CONST is translated to .rdata</LI>
    <LI>name _BSS is translated to .bss</LI>
</UL>
   This also affects simplified segment directives, since _TEXT, _DATA, CONST and _BSS segments
   are internally generated when directives .CODE, .DATA, .CONST or .DATA? are detected.
</LI>
<LI>If COFF is selected, Masm will ignore segment combine type STACK and treat stack segments just like normal
    data segments ( the MS linker and compatibles will set the stack's size with commandline options ).
    JWasm DOES NOT ignore combine type STACK for the COFF output format; additionally, unless the segment contains 
    initialized data, <b>JWasm will reset the size of stack segments to 0</b>.
</LI>
<LI>Directive <b>EXTERN name (altname) : &lt;type&gt;</b> will define a weak external with 
    characteristics IMAGE_WEAK_EXTERN_SEARCH_LIBRARY ( see MS PE and COFF specification ).</LI>
<LI>Directive <b>ALIAS &lt;aliasname&gt;=&lt;actual name&gt;</b> will define a weak external with 
    characteristics IMAGE_WEAK_EXTERN_SEARCH_ALIAS ( see MS PE and COFF specification ).</LI>
<LI>There are some cmdline options to control the extent of symbols that are written to the COFF
    output module: <A HREF="CMDOPTZLCOFF.htm">-zlf</A>, <A HREF="CMDOPTZLCOFF.htm">-zlp</A> and <A HREF="CMDOPTZLCOFF.htm">-zls</A>.</LI>
