<H1>   6.2.1 Win64 Structured Exception Handling (SEH)</H1>

    SEH in Win64 differs significantly from the implementation in Win32.
    It's very well possible to ignore Win64 SEH for assembly. However,
    if an assembly routine wants to comply to these rules, a thorough
    understanding of the Win64 ABI is necessary. Masm ( the 64-bit
    version ) supplies some "primitives" for SEH support (.ALLOCSTACK,
    .PUSHREG, .SAVEREG, ...), along with a new FRAME attribute for the
    PROC directive. These features are also supported by JWasm. See sample
    <A HREF="AB01.htm">Win64_3</A> how the "primitives" are to be used for SEH support.
<P>
    The big disadvantage is that using the FRAME keyword in Masm "disables"
    most of the other high level features combined with PROC (function 
    parameters, locals and registers saved with USES) because no function
    prologues and epilogues are generated anymore. Additionally, the 
    implementation in some Masm versions seems to be a bit buggy.
    Because of this and to ease the usage of SEH in Win64 there is a new 
    directive implemented in JWasm:
<PRE><font color="#008040"> 
        <A HREF="OPTFRAME.htm">OPTION FRAME:AUTO</A>
</font></PRE><P> 
    If this option is set, JWasm will create Win64 SEH-compatible prologues
    and epilogues. If the option is off, JWasm will behave Masm-compatible,
    that is, FRAME found in a PROC directive will disable automatic 
    prologue/epilogue generation. See sample <A HREF="AB02.htm">Win64_3e</A> how this option
    is supposed to be used.
<P> 
    As for the PROC syntax: The Masm documentation states that FRAME can be
    used in combination with USES and procedure parameters and must be
    located behind all parameters. However, this syntax isn't accepted by
    any Masm version. The only syntax which Masm will accept without being
    confused is FRAME as the one and only parameter for PROC. Therefore
    JWasm doesn't follow the Masm documentation in this point: the optional
    FRAME keyword is expected *before* the procedure parameters. The syntax
    in JWasm is:
<P><pre><font color="#008040"> 
    procname PROC [public] FRAME[:exc_handler] [USES &lt;reglist&gt;] [parameters]
<P></font></pre> 
    The SEH "primitives" will generate some additional data in segments
    .pdata and .xdata. This data is somewhat hidden, but JWasm will display
    the corresponding data definitions in the listing if option -Sg is set.
