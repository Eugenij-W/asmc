Asmc Macro Assembler Reference
<H2>Parsing of labels</H2>

<p>All expansions are pre-processed by the assembler and this may expand macros
and other directives before labels. If a macro is added at the same line as a
label this may fail.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre>
foo	macro	reg
	bswap	reg
	exitm	&lt;reg&gt;
	endm

do:	mov	eax,foo( eax )
	...
	mov	ecx,"3210"
	jmp	do
</pre>

<p>As a result the code produced by the macro will be expanded above the label
and thus the jump will fail.</p>

<pre>
	bswap	ecx
do:	mov	eax,ecx
	...
</pre>

<p>Asmc will expand the line left to right in this case.</a>
