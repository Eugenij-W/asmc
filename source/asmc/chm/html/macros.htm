<H2>Expansion of macros</H2>

<p>The <a href="labels.htm">label issue</a> becomes a problem in
<a href="hll.htm">the HLL section</a> where labels are created later:</p>
<pre>
	.WHILE	macro(...)
</pre>

<p>Asmc will for this reason delay expansion of macros in some of the HLL
directives until labels are created. This include .WHILE, .ELSEIF, and .CASE.</p>
